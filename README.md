# SAS_courseProject_faceRecognition
The goal of this project is to create a software implementation of facial I.D. in MATLAB using the DCT with KNN classifier, and to develop an understanding of how the KNN classifier works.

There are two lab manuals. One titled "course_project" was sent via email on Oct. 6, and the other can be accessed via canvas. In addition, there was a lecture on the instructions of the course project.
